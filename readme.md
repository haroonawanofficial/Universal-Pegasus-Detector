## 🌐 Why Country Coverage Matters

Modern spyware operations:
- Use **multi-country C2 routing**
- Operate via **cloud regions far from the victim**
- Rotate domains across **dozens of jurisdictions**
- Exploit **regional telecom and carrier differences**

**Universal Pegasus Detector v4.0**:
- Does **not rely on country-specific IOCs**
- Uses **AI + behavior + network intelligence**
- Remains effective **regardless of where the attack originates**

> **Result:** One engine. Any country. Any device. Any variant.

## 🏁 Final Note

✔️ **195+ countries supported**  
✔️ **No regional limitations**  
✔️ **Designed for global, cross-border surveillance detection**

This makes the tool suitable for **international investigations, NGOs, journalists, SOCs, and state-level incident response teams**.
